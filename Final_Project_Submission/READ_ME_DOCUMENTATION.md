I created this piece because I wanted people to feel calm and just relax while listening to nature's different sounds by the ocean. My project mimics music streaming apps
like Spotify where you can simply skip to different parts of the audio file or just listen to the whole thing! 

While coding my project, I did come across several setbacks. One of them was when I did not understand how I could make the square buttons clickable and then I found helpful links
online such as YouTube and Processing.org that helped me code this part of my project. The confusing part was detecting the mouse location and validating if it was cliked on the shape 
or not. Another obstacle I came across was fixing the audio output latency problem. At first I had four files for each different sound but the program couldn't handle the numerous files
and therefore didn't play any audio at all. I decided to combine the audio files together into one file and code my program to make it jump to a certain time stamp (in seconds) depending 
on the button that was clicked. This way, the audio file was able to play immediately after running the code. 

I enjoyed coding using the Object Oriented technique and the SoundFile library. The Object oriented technique really made coding easier and I was able to code efficiently too.
Overall I think this project was a success and I hope I can continue to make more interesting and interactive applications in the future!
